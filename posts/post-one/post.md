*Saline, Snow at sea*
---
*Clear as night, clear as day, the breath within falls away,*<br>
*Clear as breath, smooth as silk, slick like milk,*<br>
*Slick like milk, dripping slowly, lowly paper daubed holy,*<br>
*Daub the man, write the sin, paint it on his skin,*<br>
*Darkest day, dark like night is, the breath within rises,*<br>
*Dark as breath, jagged, heaving. You'll be leaving.*<br>

The skipper of the barge shifted his weight from feet to foot, met the two of them only minutes ago.
Only minutes ago the two of them proposed he take them both out onto the open waters and do so
discreetly in the low dusk. The rain had been turning from mist to clear pebble to soft sleet. The
both of them from the floor up in black, boots and hoods and the tall man's face pale white, wrapped
in gauze and bandage, black bruising around the eyes peeking from behind the cladding. Pale brown
mud, chocolate spatter, up the side of the littler one. A glimpse of feminine features when she
finally looked up, the tall one doing the little talking required. The money wasn't really enough,
the weather being what it was, but no one else was paying him. The river had fjorded inland over the
years, lapping up past his garden gate. Someone in the local up the road had probably recommended
him. He hadn't asked, wasn't fussed. <br>
Skipper of the barge's heart started a slight tremor on the way out of the dock when the tall one
started rooting in his bag for something - immediately expecting a weapon. The tall one's battered
face invoking the rites of violence. The thin little screen retrieved - with a sigh from
the skipper - illuminated his battered mug from below. His dark hood pulled down now, allowing his
head free movement. Spikes of hair and ear pasted haphaz onto the winding white. He was navigating,
little numbers changing at the top of the screen, little arrow directing the way. SOTB caught the
little one staring over, an realised he'd been doing the same. <br>
All that remained of the day's dying light was a keen blue ember on the surface of the sky, crept
out from below the line of clouds hanging over the landscape, dusting now with proper snow. The cold
air streaming in through the open sides of the cabin. The singing of the electric motor matched the
slapping of the waves, ducking at each auditory crest like side-chained sound. Boat in low gear,
slow moving but building momentum out and away from the picture of the land moving away in the rear
window's spattered glass. The prow separating the sea and the space above it like a plow turning
earth. Furrows of the universe reeking of soil in the wake. Coming closer to the little screen's
destination, the tall one pointing the way. Dark waves breaking against the soft salt grey
shuddering away to become a solid structure upon eerily still water. A ring of calm. The girl now,
with glances through a set of small binoculars, searching. Rounding the building slowly, she said
under her breath "It's been searched, but that doesn't mean it's not still in there." To the SOTB
now "Could you bring us close?" <br>
At an alcove in the wall they leave the wheelhouse and step into the building...
